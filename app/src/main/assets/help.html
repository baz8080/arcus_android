			<b>Searching</b>
			<p>To start simply start typing in the search box and results will appear as you type.</p>  
			<p>Alternatively, if your device supports it, you will see a microphone icon. Clicking on the icon will allow you to speak a word to get results. This uses a Google service so please be conscious that it may use your data plan.</p>
			<p>Clicking the hardware search key or menu&gt;search will place the cursor in the search box and highlight any existing text.</p>
			<p>Please note that words are not sorted purely alphabetically by default.  This is a feature whereby words are weighted according to their usage frequency in language. There is an option to disable this in the application settings menu, which will be described below.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<b>Favourites</b>
			<p>After a search you can press the star icon beside a word to save it to your favourites.  Pressing the icon again will remove it.</p>
			<p>You may also view all of your favourites by pressing menu&gt;favourites. In this view pressing the menu key will allow you to sort your favourites alphabetically and by date. You may also delete all favourites or email them to somebody.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<b>Pronunciations</b>
			<p>Pressing the play icon beside a word will use your phone's text to speech feature to pronounce the word. You may be prompted to install voice data if your phone does not have this installed already. After installing this data for the first time it may be necessary to enter a new search before the speech engine is available.</p>
			<p>You may choose between US and UK English and this will be described below in the 'Settings' section.</p>
			<p>Please ensure that your media volume is not muted because this will prevent the speech from being audible. If you experience issues please also ensure that you have not chosen to override application voice settings. The quality of the pronunciations are dictated by the speech engine installed on your phone.</p>
		</div>
	
		<div>	
			<b>Clickable Text</b>
			<p>Pressing the link icon beside a word will turn certain words in the definition into hyperlinks. You can click on any of these to search for that word within the dictionary.</p>
			<p>Please note that every word may not have an search result offline and that simple words are excluded by default</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<b>Sharing Words</b>
			<p>Pressing the share icon beside a word will show you all of the sharing options that are supported by your phone.  These options can include SMS, email, twitter, Facebook and bluetooth.</p>
			<p>At present Facebook is not working properly because they expect to get an URL to share and not simple text</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<b>Using Web Dictionaries</b>
			<p>In addition to the offline data you may also search for definitions using online web dictionaries.  The definition will be opened in your default web-browser.</p>
			<p>Long-pressing on a result will show a context menu that allows you to perform the search. Please be aware that this may cost you money if you are not on WiFi.</p>
			<p>This option will also be shown if there are no results or no exact results for your search</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<b>Random Word Widget</b>
			<p><b>The widget is not available when the app installed on your SD Card.</b>  This is a current Android limitation.  If you wish to use the widget move the app to phone storage (Settings> Application> Select Arcus Dictionary> Click 'Move to Phone').  Please see <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/install-location.html#ShouldNot">this page</a> for more details.</p>
			<p>After the application has been installed and opened for the first time you will be able to add a 'Word of the Day' style widget to your homescreen. You add the widget in the normal way by long pressing on a homescreen and choosing the "Arcus Dictionary Pro" widget from the list that shows up.</p>
			<p>The widget will update around twice a day but you can get a new word at any time by clicking on the green refresh icon near the top right of the widget</p>

			<b>Settings</b>
			<p>The application settings screen can be accessed from the main search screen by pressing the menu key on your phone.</p>
			<p><b>Alphabetical Sorting: </b>You can choose to use alphabetical sorting rather than the default sorting by frequency analysis.</p>
			<p><b>Auto-Correct: </b>This option enables Android's built in auto-correct and auto-complete options for the search box.'</p>
			<p><b>Fast initialisation</b>This option bypasses the database integrity check at startup. Enabling it can improve the startup speed of slower devices significantly.</p>
			<p><b>Internet Usage: </b>Check this option to disable Internet usage. This will ensure that you don't use any features that would cost you money on your data plan</p>
			<p><b>Adult Word Filter: </b>Check this option to enable the adult word filter. This will block a list of potentially offensive words from appearing in the random word widget.</p>
